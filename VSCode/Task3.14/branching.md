## Branching

---
---

*Branching* lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.

By default, your repository has one branch named **main** that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to **main**.

When you create a branch off the **main** branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of **main** as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the **main** branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
